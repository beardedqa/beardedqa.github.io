When you open stepstone.de and look for a “Tester” job, over 1100 offers will be presented. In comparison, it’s almost 2700 jobs for “Quality Assurance” but is it really a difference?
Testing is a very complex term but still a part of quality assurance process. Let’s look on few quality assurance components.

As you can see, testing is mandatory but no sufficient step to assure quality of your product. That means, tester usually “only” validates if what was delivered, fits requirements. What quality assurance really is, are all actions needed to produce good quality software – from the very beginning to the very end (and release is not the end of the story!). 


Quality assurance process starts with first requirement, which may be very high level (“We need to implement something”). The first question that should appear is “What problem do we want to solve?” and dig deeper and deeper into customer’s way of thinking to extract what he really needs. Outcome of this conversation is usually different from first requirements. With that understanding, dev team can propose and agree on a solution and prepare technical requirements and start coding & testing. This process should not finish here, but we’ll get back to it later.

That’s not an accident that coding and testing are coming together. With continuous testing approach, tests preparation (on all levels) should begin here and last till the end of coding as its integral part. That provides instant feedback for developers and allows team to react immediately if any adjustments, like change of requirements, are needed. After all quality verifications, team is ready to release their work. 
Release process looks slightly different in each company but main points are usually the same – deploy code to higher environment(s) and validate if integration with other teams’ code went fine. 
Code is live, validation passed, but it still doesn’t mean that working solution was released. It’s impossible to check everything, so a team should monitor if and what effects their release may have to live environment. It’s up to the team to decide what and when should be monitored. 
As mentioned before, quality assurance is process contains all actions needed to produce good quality software but these actions don’t have to be strictly connected with technical work. That means if your colleague is doing something critical for the project and he needs coffee, you should grab a mug and ask if it should be with sugar. And I really mean it! It will not only help you (as a team) deliver what needs to be done, but also build connection between people and good atmosphere what is very important ingredient to build quality oriented team.
As Aristotle said, **“Quality is not an act, it is a habit”** and as soon as we become creatures of that habit, we’ll make our life easier.
