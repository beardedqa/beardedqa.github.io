Hi!<br>
My name is Tomek, I'm a quality freak. <br>
I've always seen the lack of quality as a problem - in daily use products, clothes, electronic, cars etc. 
My way of fighting with mediocrity is working as a **Quality Assurance Engineer** and this blog will focus on that part of my life.
<br><br>
I am Pole located in Warsaw, however I decided to run this blog not in my native language for various reasons. 
First of all, tech community is in general fluent in English so it seems like a smart way to reach people from around the world. 
Second, that will be bigger challenge and learning for me, as my English is not always as perfect as it could be (feel free to correct me anytime ;) )
<br> <br>
If you want to see a little bit more of my private live, you can find my *Instagram* profile in the footer or just search for bearded.qa. 
<br>Warning: you will find there mostly car, cat and travels.
